              Act One was getting the recipe right. Learning what makes the filling creamy without being heavy. Finding the crunch that holds up for ten minutes after plating. Dialing in the seasoning until it was automatic.
            </p>
            <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.85, color: "var(--charcoal)" }}>
              Act Two is taking that recipe and building something real. A catering company that proves the product in the field — at weddings, corporate events, pop-ups, and dinner parties — before scaling into retail. It's the smart way to build a food business, and it starts with making people happy, one plate at a time.
